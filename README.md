# Bikesharing
NYC Citibike with Tableau

## Overview 
***Background***

Inspired by a recent trip to NYC, we are interested in starting up a similar bikesharing business for the state of Des Moines, Iowa.  Although Des Moines and New York City are vastly different, we decide to brainstorm ideas on how this potential business may work by first looking at how it works in NYC. To figure out how a bikesharing company might work in Iowa, we first need to pull data from a bike sharing company in NYC to understand the logistics. 

We specifically need to answer the following questions for a business proposal to a potential investor: 

- What type of customers use bikeshare programs? 
- Where are the most popular places for bikesharing? 
- How long are bikes being used? And by which customers? 

***Purpose***

The purpose of this analysis is to use Tableau to create visualizations to tell a story of how Bikesharing works in NYC using real-world bikesharing data.
